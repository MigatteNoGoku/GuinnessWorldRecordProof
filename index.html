<P> <font face="verdana" color="black"> Hey there! This is the webpage dedicated to my world record. My name is Omkar Shinde, and along with Matt Straughan, I am formally applying for the World Record title of Most Cash Legitimately Earned in 12 hours on Grand Theft Auto Online. I chose this because it conforms with all of Guinness's standards for a record, and I truly love videogames! Shown above is a screenshot of my most recent activity pre record attempt. Looking at my Rockstar Games Social Club profile here, you can see it verifies how much I have obtained from jobs and so forth. Money earned through modding the game and buying in-game currency with real life currency doesn't show up here. </P>
